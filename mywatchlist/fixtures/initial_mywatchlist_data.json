Storyline just flat not sure what is the message writers try to share is it terorist demo or about the wide sadnest coz her husband passed away on duty.

Rooster (Miles Teller) is among the recruits which Maverick tries to reconnect after the incident with his father in the previous film.",

It had to confront the problems and heartbreak from the last Mcu film while retaining the humour and action from the previous Spider-Man film. Not only does it do this far more successfully than I could have imagined, yet it adds so much more to the film. From unexpected plot twits to silly romance. This film is a must see to any fan of the Mcu. Make sure you stay till the very very end. You will regret it if you leave early. Post credit scenes will blow your mind in a short space of time",

The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.",
